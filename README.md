Title: "Pacman's Quick Quest : A Maze Navigation Project"

Introduction:
"Pacman's Quick Quest " is an interactive Python project that explores the fascinating world of maze navigation using the classic arcade game character, Pacman. Inspired by the iconic game mechanics of Pacman, this project combines elements of pathfinding algorithms and graphical visualization to create an engaging experience for users interested in maze-solving challenges.

Overview:
The project aims to implement various pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest route for Pacman to navigate through a maze from a starting point to an endpoint while avoiding obstacles. We can interact with the program by observing Pacman's movement in real-time as it explores the maze and dynamically adjusts its path to find the optimal route.

Features:

Graphical Visualization: This project utilizes the Graphics module in Python to provide a visually appealing representation of the maze environment. Users can observe Pacman's movement and the exploration process in a graphical window, enhancing their understanding of the pathfinding algorithms at work.
Pathfinding Algorithms: "Pacman's Quick Quest " incorporates popular pathfinding algorithms such as A* (A-star) search, and Breadth-First Search (BFS). These algorithms analyze the maze structure and compute the shortest path for Pacman to reach the endpoint while efficiently avoiding obstacles.

Dynamic Movement: As Pacman traverses the maze, where users can witness its dynamic movement from the starting point towards the endpoint. The project provides a real-time visualization of Pacman's exploration, allowing users to track its progress and observe how the chosen path evolves based on the selected algorithm.

User Interaction: Users can interact with the program by selecting different maze configurations, adjusting the starting point and endpoint positions, and choosing between different pathfinding algorithms. This interactive feature enhances user engagement and provides opportunities for experimentation and further learning.

Performance Evaluation: This project includes functionality to measure and evaluate the performance of each pathfinding algorithm in terms of computational efficiency and path quality. Users can compare the results obtained by different algorithms and gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

Benefits:
"Pacman's Quick Quest " offers several benefits to users interested in maze navigation and pathfinding algorithms:

Educational Value: This project serves as a valuable educational tool for students and enthusiasts interested in learning about pathfinding algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios.

Problem-Solving Skills: Users can enhance their problem-solving skills by experimenting with different maze configurations and algorithmic approaches to find the shortest path for Pacman.
